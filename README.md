# Crime Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing crime data and predicting future crime rate using machine learning. It features a RandomForestRegressor model for prediction and an interactive website for user interaction.

## Features

- **Crime Prediction:** Uses a RandomForestRegressor model trained on historical crime data to predict future crime rates.
- **Interactive Website:** Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display predictions and gather user inputs.
- **AI Chatbot:** An AI-powered bot integrated into the website to answer queries related to crime, laws, and predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used

- Machine Learning: RandomForestRegressor (Python, scikit-learn)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- AI Chatbot: Custom AI model for answering crime-related questions
